# SiteSave

SiteSave is a Full Stack Vue application using [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/) and [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) on the backend. 

It features authentication; you can register and log in. Once logged in, you can add websites that you'd like to save, entering the URL, title, description, and image. All of that info is saved in the database file.

### Usage


```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/justinformentin/sitesave

# Go into the repository
cd sitesave

# Install dependencies for frontend - client
cd client
npm i

# Install dependencies for backend - server
cd ../server
npm i

# Run the app
npm start
npm start
```

The client will be running at localhost:8080 and the server will be running on port:8081.
